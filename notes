PROCESSES
- includes open files, signal handlers (?)
- each process has a pid, ppid (parent process id) and pgid (process group id)
- when a parent process dies before the child, the process gets adopted by init
        so it has a ppid of 1
        exception for machines using systemd: instead, it's ppid 2, kthread
